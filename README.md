    In landscape mode on mobile, Travel link requires double tap to open travel section. It just expands after the first tap.

    When certain items expand on hover, the vertical and lateral scroll bars show up

    Tab description is just the URL and should be "Benjamin Shapiro's Photography"

    Disable right click or make images only shareable by social media instead of downloadable
